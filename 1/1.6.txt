With `new-if`, Alyssa will not be able to compute any square roots at all! This
is because the interpreter, when attempting to evaluate `new-if`, will evaluate
both the then-clause and the else-clause -- it doesn't consider the else-clause
to be an *optional* branch, instead "understanding" it as an argument to the
procedure `new-if` which must be evaluated to determine the value of `new-if`.
This causes an infinite recursion since `sqrt-iter` will *always* call itself,
which prevents `sqrt` from ever returning a value.

The built-in `if` special form avoids this by only evaluating the clause we
want, based on the result of the predicate.
