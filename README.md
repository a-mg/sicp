I'm reading [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_][sicp]. This
repo contains my working/notes/solutions to the exercises. I'm using [Racket][rl]
as the Scheme interpreter, with the [`sicp`][rp] package, and using
[this nice PDF version][pdf] of the book.

This is really more an archive of my work than a useful public project, since
you'll learn more by reading the book yourself than looking at my code!
